# INACTIVITY SESSION USING REDUX
* In this project there is a way for management the inactive user session.
* In this example there are two counters, the first counter is for shoot an action alert, and the second counter is for shoot an action that will close the session user.
* If the user touch the page or move the mouse or click or type in the application section page, both counters will restart.
